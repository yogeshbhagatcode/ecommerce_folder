For a committed tax transaction, the status in the Tax Detail Report is “Committed.” For an uncommitted tax transaction, the status in the Tax Detail Report is “Uncommitted.” Possible values: - `true`: This is a committed tax transaction. - `false` (default): This is not a committed tax transaction.  A committed tax request is a tax service request that sets the status field in the Tax Detail Report to committed. The committed status indicates that the amount calculated by the tax service is included in the amount of a capture or credit.  Use a void service request to cancels a committed tax request or a committed refund tax request. The void transaction is included as a separate entry in the Tax Detail Report. The value of the status field is cancelled. The value of the link ID is the request ID of the committed tax request or refund tax request that was voided.
