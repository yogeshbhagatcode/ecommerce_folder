class SnapMap:
    '''
    Map for deciding which angle the knob will have when mouse-dragging.


    Here we have three "scales" we are playing in:

    1. The "ratio" scale. See documenation on Knob for that one. This controls
       the angle of the knob and the actual value of the final variable.

    2. The "y" scale. This is the `y` reading of the mouse on the screen.

    3. The "pos" scale. This is a convenient mediator between the first two. It
       is reversed from "y", because on the screen a higher number of y means
       "down", and that's just wrong. Also, it has some translation.

        This number is the basis for calculating the height of the area in which
        the user can play with the mouse to turn the knob. Beyond that area the
        knob will be turned all the way to one side, and any movement farther
        will have no effect.
